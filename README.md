# Introduction

TechieMeme is a website meant to lighten up peoples day who like technology or related things. Like Code, science, maths or hardware as an example. Inspiration for this site came from Code Institute Slack channel **community-tech-humour**, which I really love. On this site the user can view, like and comment on the memes that they like or upload their own memes and edit, delete them if necessary. This website was created as a learning exercise for my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/) fourth portfolio project. 

The live app can be foundÂ [here.](https://techiememe-50a6f4eb45eb.herokuapp.com// "TechieMeme.")

# Design

### Look and feel

With design for this website the aim was to create a fun and easy to use website. Main colors were chosen form black to emoji icon yellow. Had to add some CSS text-shadow trickery to improve the contrast on the light background. Also to improve accessibility for people with visual impairments some of the meme text was changed to darker yellow. 
### Colour

Color palette was chosen and made on [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

![Color Palette](/static/images/readme_images/palette.png)

### Typography

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for the font.

Font Lexend was chosen for the site. This font was chosen because it is easy to read and looks good on all devices. By using this font the site is more accessible for people with visual impairments whilst. Two font weights are used, 400 and 700. 400 is used for the main text and 700 is used for the logo and some headings where **bold** text is required. Fall back font is Sans-serif.

| Font Weight 400 | Font Weight 700 |
| --- | --- |
| ![Lexend 400](/static/images/readme_images/lexend_400.png) | ![Lexend 700](/static/images/readme_images/lexend_700.png) |

### Wireframes

#### Desktop Wireframe

Didn't stray too far from the original wireframe. Only few small things. Text on the footer, banner and added carousel to main page instead of pagination as it is on all the other pages.

# Agile Development

Link to my [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/Inc21/projects/6)

As it is my first time using Agile Development, I decided to use the [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) and [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) prioritization method. I used [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/Inc21/projects/6) to create the board. 

Did find it a bit difficult to use at first but after a while I got the hang of it. As for a solo developer who is time constrained, I found it a bit time consuming to create all the Epics and User stories. But I can see the benefits of using this method in a team environment. As of now I will continue to use this method for my future projects and I hope to learn more about it. My first ever hackathon is coming soon where I will be working in a team and I will be surely using Agile method.

I created 4 columns, Epics, To-Do, In Progress and Done. I also created 9 labels:

- For MoSCoW prioritization: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have.

![Must Have](/static/images/readme_images/labels/must-have.png) ![Should Have](/static/images/readme_images/labels/should-have.png) ![Could Have](/static/images/readme_images/labels/could-have.png) ![Won't Have](/static/images/readme_images/labels/wont-have.png)

- And 5 helper labels: Dev-task, Epic, User-story, In-progress, Done.

![Dev-task](/static/images/readme_images/labels/dev-task.png) ![Epic](/static/images/readme_images/labels/epic.png) ![User-story](/static/images/readme_images/labels/user-story.png) ![In-progress](/static/images/readme_images/labels/in-progress.png) ![Done](/static/images/readme_images/labels/done.png)

- Created 9 Epics divided into 24 User stories. Epics and user stories are connected with # link on the title and in the description.

| Example | Image |

| [waitress](https://pypi.org/project/waitress/) | Waitress is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptable performance. It has no dependencies except ones that live in the Python standard library. It runs on CPython on Unix and Windows under Python 2.7+ and Python 3.5+. It is also known to run on PyPy 1.6.0 on UNIX.

## Interesting bug or problems

As is now common with my Code Institute projects, most of this was one interesting problem to solve.
A few of the more interesting ones are listed below.
- How to convert all images to more web friendly format.
    - This was solved by using [Django-resized](https://pypi.org/project/django-resized/) package. This package will convert all images to .webp format and resize them. This will save space and bandwidth.
- Creating the functionality to comment on the memes took much more time then expected. It actually turned out not to be this difficult but I was overthinking it.
    - This was solved by creating a new model for comments and then creating a form for that model. Then I created a view for the form and added it to the single meme page. 
     

## Unfixed Bugs

- IntegrityError at /accounts/social/signup/ 
```UNIQUE constraint failed: account_emailaddress.email```
    - This error is caused by the user trying to sign up with the same email address that they used to sign up with Google or GitHub.
- Carousel misalignment on mobile devices.
    - This is caused by the carousel needing to move different amount of pixels on different devices. Will be solved in the future just ran out of time this iteration.
- Search result pagination.
    - When user enters a short search term, the pagination will show but as as soon as you turn the page it reloads memes page. This is caused by the search term being in the title or description of the meme. Will be solved in the future just ran out of time this iteration.
